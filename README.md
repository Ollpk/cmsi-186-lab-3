In this repository, I implemented three classes: a die class (which represents a single die with an unchangable number of sides yet a changeable value for what can be on each face of the die), a DiceSet class (which represents at least two or more Die objects however must have all the Die have the asme number of sides), and a HighRollerGame class (which is a command line game that rolls the dice) and prints out the highest score of what you have rolled.
